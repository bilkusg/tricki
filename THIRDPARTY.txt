This application depends heavily on three third-party libraries.
Copies of the relevant files are included here to make it easy to deploy 
tricki without worrying about the detail. But I like to give credit where
it's due

So thanks to prototype.js http://prototypejs.org for dom manipulation
and to http://crypto.standord.edu/jscl for the Stanford Crypto Library
and to http://debris.demon.nl/javascript for davclient.js
